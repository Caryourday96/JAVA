# JAVA
Created a desktop software for a Cab Company ( personal project ).
I did it to learn how to work with multiple (Screens) Jframes.
and also how to handle the multiple screens and not have them show up at the same time.
Basically , hiding and showing the needed screens.
I also learned how to handle Create , Read , Update and Deleting (CRUD) from a connected SQL database to the program.
